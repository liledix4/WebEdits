# WebEdits

Edits for websites, to improve your experience!

All modifications are purely visual! **This is not hacking!** This repository contains **NOTHING** that can automate anything on the websites or change their behavior! JavaScript and any other types of automations are NOT used in the browser. There are NO external connections used – except the usage of `npm install` for installing Node.js packages on the local machine, **which you don't have to do**.

## Helpful software

### Browser extensions

## Installation? & usage

**You don't have to install anything.** It's enough to find the files you need and copy their contents into the above-mentioned tools.

However, if you have Node.js installed on your machine – you can clone this repository to any folder of your choice, and then run `install.bat` file. In this case, these Node.js packages will be downloaded:

- [`@webextensions/live-css`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webextensions/live-css) – runs the server for Live CSS Editor extension, it allows to interact with local CSS/SCSS/Less files in the browser.
    - Ad blockers may block the extension, so you need to whitelist the website or turn off the ad blockers completely.

`run.bat` executes these packages.
